Before you run the code
1. Make sure to add all required resources
2. For jar libraries, it's mostly inside *"BasdatGUI/src/lib"*
3. If you can't find it there, then the resoure you are looking for is inside *"jar, plugin, nmb"* folder
4. As for plugin, this program use *"org-jdesktop-layout-RELEASE65.nbm"* and *"1383067774_iReport-5.5.0-plugin.zip"*
